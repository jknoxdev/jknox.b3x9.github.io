Thanks you two! I asked ChatGPT to elaborate: 

Here’s a comedic parody version of the Ten Commandments with a “Linux Bible” spin:

## The Ten Commandments of Linux

1.	Thou shalt have no other kernels before Linus.
>"In the beginning, there was Linus, and Linus said, ‘Let there be code.’ And thus, Linux was born."
	
2.	Thou shalt not make unto thee a proprietary OS, nor worship closed-source software.
> "For I, the Open Source, am a jealous system, visiting the bugs of the fathers upon their children, but granting patches unto all who commit responsibly."
	
3.	Thou shalt not take the name of Linux in vain, nor swear by the sudo command lightly.
>"For sudo gives, and sudo can take away."
	
4.	Remember the update, and keep it frequent.
>"Thou shalt not ignore package updates, lest dependency hell rise against thee."

5.	Honor thy sysadmin and thy dev, that thy uptime may be long upon the network.
>"For without them, thou art but a user, and users know not what they do."

6.	Thou shalt not kill -9 recklessly.
>"For thou mayest think thou hast stopped a process, but lo, it shall rise again, daemon-like, when least expected."

7.	Thou shalt not commit adultery… with Windows.
>"For no dual-booting with unholy systems shall be forgiven without repentance and the installation of GRUB."

8.	Thou shalt not steal code without attribution.
>"For the GPL sees all, and those who violate it shall be smitten by lawyers and open-source warriors alike."

9.	Thou shalt not bear false outputs against thy neighbor’s script.
>"When debugging, thou shalt check thine own log before casting blame upon others."

10.	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s distro, nor his package manager, nor his config files.
>"For though his dotfiles may seem more elegant, remember thou art free to fork and make them thine own."
