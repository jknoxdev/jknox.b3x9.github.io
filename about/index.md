### b3x9
b3x9 is an idea to have a hosting framework for cyber and infosec people to build out their own tech stack. I'm hoping to get enough people involved, that we can build our own AD and pay for the cloud hosting as a group of volunteers kind of like [dn42](https://dn42.us/). for now, it's just a framework for me to host my profile page and maybe a few others that are inteterested! 


###### banners
Also, you might see some of these banners posted on this site.

In the spirit of the day, I saw this over on [shellshark](https://shellsharks.com/)'s blog and I thought it'd be cool to show which parts of my site and projects have been helped with the GPT's. I've also hosted these on my CDN, feel free to copypasta the img refs for your own pages!
